# Creating dags with airflow Using sql
#### Background
- The goal of this repo is to showcase the use of sql, python and airflow to create Data Pipelines that can deal with certain challenges for an NBA dataset
- The main goal is to deal with slow chaning dimensions aswell as working with Cumulative table desing

- This is part of the EcZachly Data Engineering bootcamp and this is an extension in one of the projects that we had to developed

- This is still a work in process repo. I am working in getting the Airflow and database connected inside the Docker cluster. So the pipelines can be executed with `docker compose up`
